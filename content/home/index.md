Sound engineering that reflects our 30 plus years of experience in the business will help you create the recording you are looking for - whether you are a solo artist, singer songwriter, band, acoustic ensemble, audio book author or voice over actor. Complete production services from the start of an idea to the fully mastered finished version are easily within reach, as our team provides artistic support, including professional studio musicians if needed to complete a project. We also offer off site recording sessions and live sound mix engineering for musicians, bands, ensembles, and actors, either on or off San Juan Island.
